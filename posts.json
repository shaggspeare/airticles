No way to show who was calling while the phone was ringing.\n\nWe tried everything: workarounds, Siri hacks, manual lookup widgets. None of it felt native, fast, or right.\n\nFast-forward to 2025.

I built a few different MVPs that all seemed to work great until the time came to hook it up to a database, auth, and deploy. Every single time the project is riddled with build errors that causes Claude to get stuck in a death loop.\n\nNot being an actual developer is probably my problem. But I'd love to hear how you leveraged the tools and roughly how much of the project was Claude vs how much you built yourself and just had Claude assist. Curious about how you integrated such a clean UI/UX with the models. I tried using Shadcn on my last project to get it a little cleaner looking, but deploying with Shadcn caused another issue with tons of broken import statements that Claude couldn't sort through.",

The design is clean and intuitive, and the overall experience is fantastic.   \nWhile exploring the app, I did notice one minor issue that could be improved for an even smoother experience. When adjusting the volume slider while listening to a station, the audio sometimes pauses temporarily, and occasionally, the station seems to stop entirely, showing a loading screen for a second or two before resuming. This happens while the slider is being adjusted. It might disrupt the listening experience a bit, especially for users who frequently tweak the volume.\n\nOther than that, the app is fantastic, and I really enjoyed using it. Cheers"

I was making around $250K a year, not including stock. It was stable, prestigious ‚Äî everything you‚Äôre told to want.\n\nBut I had this dream. A vision for an app I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about. The catch? I wasn‚Äôt allowed to publish apps while working at Apple. So I left. Walked away from everything.\n\nI‚Äôve spent the past months building this app from scratch. Learned everything. Designed it, coded it, shaped it with love and obsession. It felt like¬†*me*. Something unique, something with purpose.\n\nAnd now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm days away from launching ‚Äî and I‚Äôve already spotted two other apps doing¬†*almost the same thing*. Launched. Live. Polished.\n\nI‚Äôm crushed.  \nI know competition is part of the game, but it‚Äôs hitting hard. It feels like the world is moving too fast. Like every day there‚Äôs another app, another builder, another ‚Äúme.‚Äù\n\nWhat used to feel special now feels‚Ä¶ common.  \nHow do I hold on to my fire in a world that seems to be sprinting past me?  \nHow do¬†*you*¬†deal with this kind of gut-punch?\n\nWould really love to hear from anyone who‚Äôs been there.  \nAppreciate you all for reading.",

They're not Googling alternatives to your product unless your product sucks.\n\nSimply put, if you didn't know there were competitors until recently, your customers will have no clue there are competitors. If your app solves their problem, they're not going to look up alternatives.\n\nSource: I built a SaaS in a very crowded space.

That sauce should also be your North Star and motivator, because otherwise you're giving up before you even have a chance to face the remaining 90% of hurdles that successful startups face AFTER deploying to production!\n\nThis isn't the time to give up, this is the time to lean in and interview potential customers to see what they're truly looking for in apps within your category (definitely check out the book *The Mom Test* for this).\n\nApple wasn't the first to market for personal computers OR its innovative GUI.

        "text": "**Rant:**  \nI have to be completely honest.  \nSeeing people here comment about how its okay to not be the first one and giving you hopes with kind words and clich√©s is nice and all but at some point you'll have to face the reality of things.\n\nBeing successful in the app space is HARD and you have to prepare yourself mentally to feel like shit, to have endless days of doubting yourself(which is completely natural), to have days when you question your decisions saying \"why didn't I just stay at my job\", to have days when you just want to throw everything away and go back to where you feel comfortable.\n\nThe biggest issue here is that you had a very well paying job, you were living very comfortably and now you gave it all up, so you're going to have that voice in your head saying \"if it doesn't work out I can still go back/I can find a high paying job\". You need to ditch that voice completely. In order to succeed in this you have to come to a conclusion with yourself of \"this is the thing I am going to do, period\".\n\nDon't think about going back to your old job or getting a new one every time you hit an obstacle. These thoughts will create your reality, trust me I've been there.\n\n**Some practical advice:**\n\n1. As for the competition part, you will always have competition and you will almost always have someone doing it better than you. It's not about reinventing the wheel, It's about finding a market in which you can fit in and take a slice of the cake.\n\n2.For new apps I would always suggest running an AppAdvice + AppHookup campaigns giving a free lifetime subscription and asking for a review after completing the purchase(which is free) or after a positive action the user has completed in the app.\n\n3. Coding in and of itself is not enough. Learn how to market apps(organically at first), how to monetize properly, how to engage and retain your users. I would do Advanced Searchads only after the app has earned some money and is validated.\n\n4. Dont fall in love with an idea. If your app isn't doing well after putting some time and effort, move on to the next idea.\n\n5. Find a mentor or follow someone online who can teach you the things you are not that good at. I suggest AppMasters(youtube), this guy has some serious value in his videos.\n\nThese are my 2 cents, hope this makes sense to you and best of luck.",

        "text": "I‚Äôm sorry to hear how much that‚Äôs affecting you - that sucks! But here‚Äôs my take for whatever it‚Äôs worth.\n\nLet‚Äôs pretend I‚Äôm one of those douchey narcissistic ‚Äúentrepreneurs‚Äù.  Let‚Äôs also pretend my goal is to take some random idea and start a company where someone else does the work and someone else pays and I just have my lottery ticket in the form of shares. \n\nIf I had a company and there was a team of two people, let‚Äôs say me and a developer, and let‚Äôs say I hired a developer to do the actual work so I could work on ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù and ‚Äúcompany building‚Äù. Let‚Äôs also say there was an investor that put money in to make this happen so I‚Äôm not out of pocket. \n\nNow pretend I‚Äôm at the same point: close to release but I find a competitor. But I didn‚Äôt code it personally. Someone else did. I‚Äôm busy ‚Äúrunning‚Äù the company. And also I didn‚Äôt pay for it personally as the investor footed that bill. So even though I didn‚Äôt get paid to run the company, unlike the developer who‚Äôs just a hired gun, I only have my stock in the company. \n\nSo emotionally here‚Äôs where I could be coming from: \n\nI‚Äôve invested my time and I have my lottery ticket. I‚Äôm looking to create a company and enough hype to find the next investor to then eventually just sell the whole thing to someone else and cash out. I have no emotional investment. \n\nSo what do I do about the competitor? \n\nNothing. I would see that and make a notes that I needs to launch soon and check out what they are doing and maybe put some of those ideas into the next version.\n\nBut I don‚Äôt care. From a business perspective whatever it is that I‚Äôm doing still makes sense. If people need my app then they need my app. Some of them will try the other guys app but mine will be better somehow. But I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs a business decision and if making the thing in the first place is still a sound choice then really‚Ä¶ this doesn‚Äôt really make a difference. \n\nI‚Äôm still going to launch the app. I‚Äôm still going to grow the company. I‚Äôm still going to continue to grow and evolve the app. Unless I‚Äôm trying to win a single government contract and I get nothing by being second‚Ä¶ well I really don‚Äôt care. The only reason I wouldn‚Äôt launch the app is if it was like a plugin for like Microsoft Word that does a specific thing and now Microsoft Word just comes with that thing. \n\nMy point is this:\n\nAlthough your feelings are valid and its easy to relate and have empathy because I‚Äôve had somewhat similar situations and feelings, but at the end of the day this doesn‚Äôt change anything. Having a totally unique idea feels good, and in academia it does matter when you‚Äôre the only one to do a study because it‚Äôs a new area, but in reality there are lots of ideas and apps and most of the ones we know and love weren‚Äôt the first. \n\nWhen they did a study of startups and success they found that one thing was the most important predictor of a startup doing well. It‚Äôs not the idea or the technical prowess or even the team and people. \n\nIt was timing. \n\nYou can‚Äôt try and launch Uber when there were only flip phones. You can‚Äôt launch Facebook when most people‚Äôs home computer was the Commodore 64. You can‚Äôt be too early and you can‚Äôt be too late. \n\nBut if just now - only just now - someone else besides you had this idea and executed on it well‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a good sign. I think that means the timing is pretty great! The fact that someone else thought of something similar could mean this is just the right time. \n\nNow if you have the best tech and that‚Äôs the deciding factor then you could end up being the long term leader. But if you‚Äôre tech isn‚Äôt the best well‚Ä¶ look at VHS and Betamax. Overall Betamax was a better technology but people didn‚Äôt give a shit they just wanted to record a 4-hour American football game. \n\nHonestly this is all about how you feel because it felt special and secure and safe knowing that nobody else was doing this. Now that‚Äôs changed and so too have the feelings changed. \n\nBut from a business perspective nothing has changed. You found an unmet need in the market. You put your heart into it. Now you‚Äôre ready launch. So launch! \n\n‚ÄúGreat artists steal!‚Äù and ‚ÄúGreat artists ship!‚Äù\n- The character of Steve Jobs in The Pirates of Silicon Valley misquoting Pablo Picasso\n\n\nWhat I‚Äôm trying to say is that what you are actually doing matters more than worrying about what anyone else is maybe doing. \n\nAlso: Way to go! What you‚Äôre doing is gutsy and amazing!",

I am not a software engineer, but having been in commercial strategy for years, here are some thoughts that might help:\n\nFirst, being first to market rarely determines success. Look at your former employer - Apple wasn't first with smartphones, modern laptops, or watches. They observed, refined, and created something with their unique perspective. Your vision and execution still matter tremendously.\n\nSecond, competitors can validate that there's an actual market ‚Äì this is actually good news. And remember, you don't need to capture the entire market to build something successful. Even a small slice of a growing market can be life-changing.\n\nFinally, those other apps give you invaluable intel. What are users praising? Complaining about? You can now iterate with real market feedback rather than assumptions.\n\nWhat made your app feel like \"you\" wasn't just the concept - it was your specific approach to this solution. Maybe you have knowledge of a specific industry, and that can be your niche.\n\nSo launch anyway. If there‚Äôs a market for those apps, and they‚Äôre relatively new, there‚Äôs probably room for your version too.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã\n\nIt sounds like you've got the technical development well under control.

You said you worked at apple, did you learn anything from the marketing team or what?\n* Is this something unrelated? Not everyone has what it takes to make it. This isn‚Äôt a discouragement. Be logical and practical. Ask yourself these thing;\n 1. Can I rely on other people? Or I find a way to do everything myself?\n 2. Am I open to rejection and humiliation from investors? Can I pickup the phone and call 100 of people asking for 10 minutes to pitch? And do so without being emotional about it? \n 3. Can I talk to strangers and be able to work, despite of differences. \n* Building something is the easy part brother, it gets harder for an expert to market their product. One of my mentors once said, I can manage 20 software engineers, but I don‚Äôt know shit about what they do, yet they come to me with issues, I don‚Äôt know what to do, I just say generic thing, try to take a break or something, etc. the thing is, the are too deep in their stuff that they forget to apply common sense.

Now I operate with the mindset that starting any idea needs to have at least a few competitors to validate it from the start before any further work is done. At least that‚Äôs my take so I think this is actually a good outcome for you.

The truth is, there's very few new ideas left, so trying to find a completely blue ocean is not a viable repeatable strategy anymore. Their post on this completely transformed my understanding of what it means to be building a software business today.\n\n[https://linear.app/blog/rethinking-the-startup-mvp-building-a-competitive-product](https://linear.app/blog/rethinking-the-startup-mvp-building-a-competitive-product)"

It's hard to tell from this clip, but it seems like as long as you keep running in one direction the doctor will never catch you, which breaks the game. You should consider adding obstacles that slows your character down to give the chase higher stakes. Similarly adding power ups sparingly can help make for a more intriguing game when the player is on the cusp of getting caught. Achievements would also be fun, but not necessary for release.",

For now, I‚Äôve made it super easy to import photos directly from your gallery into SelfieStory, where they‚Äôre automatically aligned for a seamless experience. This lets people who already take a selfie every day continue their journeys in the app or gives new users a way to start their SelfieStory with a bit of a head start!   \n  \nI‚Äôm also considering features like gym progress tracking, travel documentation, and even deeper customization options to make it even more personal for users.\n\nDo you have any ideas?

It doesn't include international freight, customs clearance, importer markup, distribution costs, domestic warehousing, inland freight, Amazon fees, etc. etc. etc. All things that are included in that  $114.88. The actual cost that tariff applies to is a lot less than the sell price, or even wholesale price.\n\nThen is this assuming full pass through on the tariff? Another thing that would reduce the impact to the consumer.\n\nEdit: Oh, I see. You are calculating tariff based on the sell price. Yeah, no..... Not at all how Tariffs work. I'd maybe start with the assumption that the EXW price that tariff applies too is maybe 1/3 that of the sell price at best. Likely closer to 1/4. Then apply tariff to that. But it all really depends on the after EXW costs and what their distribution tier structure is. IT would all be a wild guess though.",

If you plan to buy items for $100 you get much less for your money if the tariffs get added. Now the common unit for transport is shipment containers. Less items you buy means less items per container but the price per container stays the same. This drives you cost per item even higher. Alternative is to still order a full container (=same amount of items) but it'll cost you more driving your interest rates for the credit up. Also increasing cost per unit.\nIn addition retail takes a fixed percentage margin of your items price to put it in their shelves. If your price per item increases, retail margin in absolute dollars also goes up. Add that on top.\n\nEffects like that add up -- 150% tariffs will not simply mean you know pay 150% more, but more like 200% on top.\n\nFor anyone interested, I recommend to watch a video on YouTube from Gamers Nexus on the topic. It's about computer parts but the concepts apply in general. The catch: they have companies show their price calculations with real numbers...you might be surprised."

That way you could build a simple lookup table of multipliers for example how a 25% tariff typically translates to a 10 to 15% retail price increase in a given category, this would  make the entire calculation faster, and more scalable, AND not dependent on per product historical data.\n\nBut again, add the '~' along with a low to high range and call it a day lol."

I recommended Forest (which I was using at the time), but she found it wasn't detailed enough for her needs. \n\nSo I built her a simple, clean time tracker. No distractions - just stats and a timer to track work and study time.\n\nLater on, to make it more engaging, I added features like:\n\n* A leaderboard\n* An achievements page where you can collect badges for studying (inspired by duolingo ofc)\n\nYou can see these features on the landing page with images\n\nShe told me she liked it a lot and recommended that I share it. \n\nAfter posting it on Instagram and adding a payment option, it unexpectedly took off. Now, it generates enough income to cover my rent, which still feels crazy.\n\nIf you would like to check it out: [peazehub.com](http://peazehub.com)",

Alternatively, you could retain the lifetime plan for a period and then transition it into an annual subscription.

I think it's important to have some subscription in an app like this. Very cool app btw",

So I had some a bit of understanding from psychology of marketing and how to start. \n\nHardest was getting first user. Because I built relatively something boring looking, but i was like \"it looks good to me\". So i gathered from existing free users, like what do you like about it, what would you want extra. \n\nSo that was 1st step. I gathered feedback, and started developing more. Then i made it premium application, and kept the legacy users. Then I offered them discount count if they want to invite their friends. Which worked as well. \n\nI tried to gather feedback from twitter as well. I sent it to the every post where OPs were giving feedback. General product wise, landing page wise etc. It was also life-changing for me. \n\nAnd last step was getting some popularity and getting some people know it. Which worked in instagram when i mixed memes with pictures of my app.\n\nI don't know if i covered enough, you can ask more questions and i will try my best to answer more",

Buying a domain name for $10.\n2. Finding web hosting for $10 per month.\n3. Watching a few YouTube video tutorials on v0, Claude 3.5 Sonnet or FlutterFlow or even Wordpress with Zapier / Make / Airtable to build your minimum viable product (MVP).\n\nThat's it.¬† If it took you 6 months to launch, you'd be out $70 bucks.¬† The phone or computer you used to start this thread cost more than that, so you don't need money.¬† You need proper guidance and motivation.\n\nYou can build just about any web or mobile app with those 3 steps. If not, your idea is probably too complicated or not viable, which is why nobody has done it even though you think it's \"yet untapped and has huge potential\".\n\nYou used to need to raise millions of dollars of venture capital because it was expensive to hire a team of highly skilled engineers.¬† And it would take them 3 months just to get working code to make something appear on the screen of your MVP. ¬†\n\nNow all you need is a few text prompts to do the same thing in 3 seconds.¬† With the barrier to entry almost nonexistent now, if you want to get investors, you need to show you have the skills to build something and not just have ideas.",

We are years away from that.  Those people won't get bored.  It's like saying decades ago people will get bored with WordPress and WordPress themes.

As a developer, I can easily spend too much time in the weeds on things that my end user won't care about because they aren't aware those options exist.\n\nHere are two things that I found to be true in life.\n\n1. No client or customer cares about (other than other photographers) what lens you used, what aperture you dialed in, or which camera body or brand you shot it with.  They simply just love the photo.\n\n2. No client or customer cares about (other than coders or tech related people) which IDE you used, which programming language you wrote, or what your tech stack is.  They simply just love the site or app.\n\nI have to remind myself that when I'm wasting time debating NextJS vs Svelte vs Angular or whatever the latest shiny object is.

And if you're intentions all along as to scam or steal someone's pocket change? Sure, you may have gotten a free $10.

    "title": "Bought an online business for $11K, 3x‚Äôed my investment in 27 minutes",
    "author": "Qbase11",
    "text": "I was telling my friend this story and he got very excited, so I thought this might be a nice one to share here for some side project inspiration. I actually 3x‚Äôed the investment in cash and I didn‚Äôt even account for the appreciation of the asset value. Here‚Äôs how I did that, sorry for the long read.\n\n\n\nFor some context, I have an online business with around 50 employees but on the side I really enjoy digging through sites like Flippa to find these small online businesses that are not monetized the right way. My favourite ones are the ones that can run on auto-pilot. \n\n\n\nWhen I say ‚Äòauto-pilot‚Äô, I do mean that. I bought this website in 2013 and the site has not had anything added to it for it least 7/8 years. I don‚Äôt do any marketing and I don‚Äôt think about it. The only thing is that sometimes the site goes offline for some reason and then one of my devs gets pinged automatically and he fixes it. Then I have my assistant sending out an invoice once per quarter to the advertiser who bought all the ad space on the website. The advertiser pays $15K per year and has been doing this for the last 6/7 years or so. \n\n\n\nSo this website is a free vector website. It‚Äôs very simple; people google something, land on the website and can download the images without giving their email or anything. The images were created by the seller and his team.\n\n\n\nI found the website in 2013 when I was scrolling through Flippa and I felt right away that this could be a gem. The website was getting a lot of traffic, but the seller said he was banned from Google Adsense and monetized with Yahoo ads. He was making around $600 a month at 350K pageviews a month. \n\n\n\nI thought I could do better. \n\n\n\nAt the time, I already had experience buying websites from Flippa and I had my fair share of buying sites that turned out to be total crap. I would normally not buy sites before doing proper due diligence, but sometimes you just know something is good and then you need to be quick.\n\n\n\nThe site was for sale for around $12K I believe and after thinking things over for half an hour or so, I sent the seller a message saying ‚Äòif you reduce the BIN price to $10K, I‚Äôll click the buy button and we have a deal‚Äô. He was online and responded right away that he was willing to part with his site for $11K. ‚ÄòDeal‚Äô I said.\n\n\n\nWe discussed details about the transfer and all but in the meantime I already started to execute my plan I had in mind to increase the income significantly. My thesis was that this site was very under-monetized. Just putting Adsense back on there would have already increased the income quite a bit, but I didn‚Äôt want to risk having my own Adsense account banned and I believed there would be better ways to monetize this site.\n\n\n\nSo from the moment I clicked the buy now button, I drafted a short email and sent it out to stock photo sites. There were many stock photo companies at the time that were well-funded and it seemed that the traffic of my fresh purchase was perfectly relevant for what they offer. It just made sense; you drive traffic from Google to free stock images, people click through to your website and when they visit the page to download the free image you came for, they‚Äôll get slapped with ads from images that are often nicer than the free image. How these stock photos usually do this, is they show a widget on the publisher‚Äôs website that recognizes the theme of the main image on the page and they show related images from their database. It makes for a perfectly relevant ad that drives highly-targeted traffic to their website.\n\n\n\nSo back to the email I sent out. This was a very simple email saying ‚ÄòHey I run this stock image website and we‚Äôre getting 350K pageviews per month. I‚Äôm looking for an exclusive partner to work with for our ad traffic and I really like the quality of your stock images. I‚Äôm sending this out to 3 companies that I think would be the best partner and I‚Äôm asking for what I think is a great deal for you as an advertising partner. I‚Äôm asking a fixed price of $3K per month with a minimum duration of 6 months. \n\n\n\nI quickly found the email of the marketing departments from the 3 biggest stock sites and sent this email to them. I quickly received an email from one of the companies saying ‚ÄòWe‚Äôd like to buy the space for 12 months if you could give us one month for free‚Äô. My first thought was ‚Äòdamn, I‚Äôve sold too cheaply‚Äô but I realized this was actually a great deal, especially when I looked at the clock and saw that from the moment I bought the site, just 27 minutes past and I made a deal for $33K..exactly 3 times what I paid for the site. \n\n\n\nI lost that contract after a few years after losing a good bit of organic search traffic but signed another exclusive advertiser soon after for a lower amount. All good, because this site has really been passive income for many years with zero content updates and just paying for hosting and sending invoices to the advertiser. Most of the sites I bought in the past require more work, so don‚Äôt get all excited and start buying websites left and right.   \n  \nAny questions? Just ask. Not going to share the url though.",

That said, there could be in other channels like template sites etc. Another option is to turn it into a sort of personal boilerplate and take on individual clients as a consultant, and build them a \"custom\" website based on this. You could consider productizing it too (make a builder of sorts) but I would probably not do that because you'll be lost in a sea of much more professionally developed builders from the incumbents.",

Which is 0.01 increments and 1 is always equal to 1 pawn. So being up +1 in a game would be like having an extra pawn at the beginning of the game. So the winning is tilted in your favor by 1 pawn. Also knights and bishops are worth about 3 pawns, rooks are worth 5 pawns, and queens are worth 8 pawns. So basically if you lose a piece ( for no good reason ) your evaluation score usually drops by the equivalent amount.

I am a growth marketer who has worked/consulted with multiple companies (from global orgs to seed stage startups)\n\nNot trying to be arrogant at all. Only sharing that so you know where I am coming with my feedback. \n\nIf this isn't done already, this is an AMAZING idea. Even if it has been done, doesn't matter really.\n\n If its VERY easy for users to navigate the app, save their information (securely) , and visualize radiating, stabbing, etc... like someone mentioned above, you have an 10/10  tool on your hand.\n\n  \nEspecially the ability to store and save the pain. Potentially even adding a progress visual to see if pain is increasing or decreasing. (Handy for a pain management specialist, masseuse etc to help clients track their progress etc.)\n\n  \n100% keep up the good work. 100% go for the white labeling to clinics/physicians. This is where the money would be. \n\nIf you can keep it free to users - Amazing. 1. Its good messaging and a connection point to users, i.e. you are focused on their health and the app is free to them forever.\n\n2. If they are already using the app when they see a provider, they can just send them their data (or connect it to the physicians account etc).\n\n  \nFrom a monetization standpoint - definitely aim to white label. I see this quickly being bought out by a large hospital/healthcare company. Or at least I see them trying.\n\n  \nYou can also charge offices to have their listings show up on a map when users search for help with their pain. Or when someone selects a certain part of their body in a certain pain type, offices can pay for ads or notifications to show up \" get this checked out at xxx clinic\" - of course you'd need to get this data from the user.\n\n  \nLast thought for you - If you make it that far, and you drive users, etc.. a big potential pain point would be the data you have collected. That would be worth $$$$$$$$$$. Users will be turned off if you sell their data (if they realize it) - Consideration to see. \n\nI'll stop with the unsolicited advice now! Just thought it was a really good idea and wanted to share."

Similar to phantom limb pain, where you might feel the pain in one area, but it's receptors being triggered is from a totally different location..To do this would require some sort of nerve mapping tool like \"you feel pain here?, Here are the possible locations to check for pain to radiate to that area.\"\n\nThese are just ideas I've had ruminating in my brain for awhile for a similar pain discovery application.

                  {
                    "text": "Sure! What helped me the most was joining a vetted freelancing platform (Codeable). I tried Upwork before but it didn't work for me. Then after some time working via Codeable I transitioned to freelancing full time. It also helped that some clients started to reach out via LinkedIn because somehow they discovered my profile there. I didn't create much content but it helped me in getting found. Even today most clients find me via LinkedIn.\n\nIt's difficult to give specific advice because I don't know you :)\n\nIn general:\n\n- I think that getting experience with development first is a must in a way or another. To have something you can show. It could be with a regular job or with some side projects, that are original and solve some real problems. The good news is that side projects don't require interviews. But it should be something moderately complex and well done that you can then use to flex your skills :)\n\n- Freelancing on its own has nothing to do with dev, it's something else, and it involves a very different set of skills. It took me a long time just to more or less get started because I didn't know anyone back then who was a real freelancer. Ideally, especially if you live in a big city (it may be easier) try to meet and hangout with other freelancers. Make sure they're real freelancers: meaning they have several clients.\n\nSpeaking of which, one trap to avoid: don't be a freelancer for 1 client only, full time. I know a lot of people who work like that, they're \"employees\" under some sort of freelancer contract. And they still say they're freelancers. This thing is also illegal in most countries (fake self employment, usually connected with tax evasion), but regardless of that, it damages you and will slow you down. If you go the freelancing way it should be with several different clients.\n\n- Prepare a good website where you showcase your past work, your process to work, your services. Make sure all your social accounts align with the same content of your website.\n\nThere would be a lot more to say of course, a comment will never be enough.\n\nAnother thing that helped me a lot at the start: this [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thefutur/videos). Especially the long form videos from 2018 and 2017. I never managed to apply all their advice, but some of it helped me a lot"

After three or four years, I made a breakthrough on what I was told was impossible to achieve or has already been conceived. They were wrong, but I ran into a problem I didn't take into consideration. My technology  would be disruptive in some of the most powerful industries not interested in a technology that directly interfered with their trillion doller market. With the environmental concerns and mandates being put in place, this seems to be the first opportunity to complete and commercialize my invention. After development, prototyping, and proving my technology, I ran into another unforeseen obstacle. Apparently, not everyone can run simulation or watch complex machinery processes mentally. Thus, no one could see what seemed so simple to me. Having invented a device that not only has the ability to reduce emissions to an environmentally acceptable level, the specifications were literally off the carts used with current technology. Having few people even look at this technology long enough to realize this simple process is real, and by spinning this device, it not possible for a high compression combustion camber to be produced where nearly all forces created are transfered at 90‚Å∞ to the rotor at all times. From there, the specifications produced become even more unbelievable. What would you do in this situation? It won't be long to see what I did. Come in 2024. MadMarkTech \n    \"ForReaL\""

E.g. maybe there's a middle ground like: before opening Insta, you view 20 seconds of interesting facts, or a word of the day, or something that can actually add more value than scrolling, so at least you are counter-balancing your garbage intake :)"

It's a free tool that lets you add cool, animated subtitles to your short videos, all right in your browser. No signup, no watermarks, no paid features.\n\nOnce I made it, I thought it might be worth sharing with others. But‚Ä¶ AI costs money and video processing on the server costs money too.\n\nJust when I was about to abandon the project, I discovered transformers.js. It hit me - maybe it would be possible to get rid of server part? In the next few days I moved everything to the browser. I extended the functionality a bit to make it more customizable. And here it is. Using transformers.js and ffmpeg.wasm, everything is processed client-side. Projects are saved locally in the browser storage, so you won't lose them if you refresh the page.\n\nNote: Currently the application is available for desktop only.\n\nTry it out at [https://withsubtitles.com](https://withsubtitles.com) feedback welcome!",

The application also checks user activity and post/comment activity to make sure that they are active users. \n\nLet me know if that answers your questions!"

For example, \"I want to learn how to market my SaaS, who should I contact?\" Then, it will auto generate keywords and subreddits to match your description (and you can change or add the keywords/subreddits as well)\n\nIt doesn't need to be about SaaS, you can describe anything that you want to learn about.\n\nYou can then run this pipeline/ai agent feature, and this application will automatically scrape Reddit posts, comments, user profiles, user karma, and user activity based off of your criteria to find the users that match your needs. You can create as many pipelines as you want, and execute 3 times a day.\n\nI use this feature to connect with subject matter experts on Reddit so that I can ask questions to professionals in different fields, such as marketing or SaaS development to improve my skills if I need help on something.\n\nAfter that, it takes the application just 2 minutes to scrape the data fully, and you can then export the data as a CSV.\n\nI found it so much easier to get help from people who have experience in any field with this application.

Learning all of this and building these projects took around a year and a half.  \n  \nI then started building SaaS. Built over 8 of them over 8 months, failed all of them with 0 users. Then I finally built and marketed 2 successful products properly with all of the mistakes I have learned, and this is where I am currently! \n\nbigideasdb.com was my first successful product, built that for 3 months, and then built linkeddit.com which took around a month to build. I finally learnt how to market better and over all of these failed apps I built a good audience as well!",

    "author": "jamie452",
    "text": "It's been a year since I launched RambleFix on here, and I thought I'd share an update on how things have been going. For those who missed it, [RambleFix](https://ramblefix.com) is a tool that converts speech to text, but with a twist - it uses AI to tidy up and rewrite what it's heard into various formats like emails, articles, journal entries, lists, social media posts, or simple notes.\n\n  \n**The Journey**\n\n1. **Growth**: We've grown to $2,380 MRR across 219 active subscribers. In the past 180 days, our MRR has increased by a whopping 148.83%!\n2. **Identity Crisis**: The biggest challenge has been figuring out how to market RambleFix. Is it a speech-to-text tool? A note-taking app? A content generation tool? A transcription service? It does all four, which makes it tricky to nail down a specific marketing angle.\n3. **Feature Updates**: We've added the ability to upload audio or video files (up to 4 hours long) and the option to \"append\" to previous \"Rambles\" (that's what we call the output).\n4. **Use Cases**: People are using RambleFix in all sorts of ways - transcribing meetings, writing emails, replying to customer service tickets, and even recording morning brainstorming sessions to produce daily task lists (my personal favourite).\n5. **Business Adoption**: We had a business customer purchase 18 seats for their organisation, which was a brilliant feeling!\n\n  \n**Marketing Adventures**\n\nMarketing has been a wild ride. We started with word-of-mouth on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Our first Reddit post brought in loads of traffic (more than I've been able to replicate since). We did two Product Hunt launches - the second one got 139 upvotes and was in the top 10 for most of the launch day.\n\nWe then tried paid ads on Reddit, Meta, and Twitter. We found some success, but the customer acquisition cost was about $77, with a lifetime value of $110. A bit tight for cash flow, so lately we've let things happen organically.  \n\n\n**What's Next?**\n\n1. **SEO Focus**: The product converts well, so I'm planning to focus on SEO and content to get more eyes on RambleFix.\n2. **Mobile Apps**: I'm tempted to build iOS and Android apps, as well as a Chrome extension to make RambleFix work directly in any textbox.\n3. **Education**: I want to create more content around how RambleFix can be used in various scenarios.\n\n  \n**Some Fun Stats**\n\n* MRR growth: 4.82% in the past 30 days, 20.02% in the past 60 days\n* Subscriber growth: 5.42% in the past 30 days\n* Average sale price: $13/MRR\n* Customer churn rate: 12.15%\n\n  \nThe most surprising thing about this journey? How amazing monthly recurring revenue is. It starts adding up fast, and as long as you're growing, it keeps going up!\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions you might have about building and growing a tool like RambleFix in the current AI landscape.  \n  \nCheers!",

I wish I had known to hold off on my first Product Hunt launch - it was a total flop, I had rushed to get it out on there, naively thinking that the launch would bring vast amounts of traffic and solve my problems - but the product wasn't ready and the messaging wasn't clear that early on because I hadn't received the feedback needed to make those changes.

I can't remember the exact copy I used above the button, but it was very much along the lines of \"Click below and start rambling\". As different pricing tiers and a refreshed UI were introduced, the product ended up being placed behind the current landing page.  \n  \nAs for your question - the initial launch in my case was just a speech to text feature. User accounts were implemented very quickly after, as were the different formats of what you can transform your \"ramble\" into. I'd suggest getting something out as quick as you can, and iterating in public. Early on you're unlikely to have a ton of visitors, so there's no real issues, and if you do get lucky and have lots of traffic, your users will quickly let you know what's important to build next - there's no real downside to launching early that I can see.",

If it is useful to them, chances are, it is useful to other ppl in similar segment- ask them for 2 referrals. If they give, you can do the same with the new sign ups. This may involve active selling and is feasible in the initial stages - You should definitely do that until you Crack a channel with low CAC or reach a critical mass where it spread word of mouth.\n5) Launch referral plan and look at the results - If people are not referring others, there are changes required in the segments you are acquiring or the product itself. \n\nP.S.

I can almost bet money they will share your software for free if the end results are good.\n\n  \nPS: You may want to adjust your site to have a clear value proposition at the top.  \nSince I seen the video before going to the website I knew what it was but if I didn't it would be hard to get it if I was coming cold.\n\nHappy to point you to some people that can help if you need it. \n\nKeep going.

Said the closest thing to objective is utilitarianism: minimize pain, maximize non-pain, for the multitudes. Which included butterfly effect, like saving two criminals instead of one innocent - have to consider probability of future pain by crime.\n\nAnyway. Hitler bad, obviously. But then he said. True evil is kinda obvious and pointless here, what's really interesting is **selfishness**. It doesn't inflict pain to the multitudes; but it removes non-pain from them (especially over time), so it's the same. Musk takes from the world money that could be had for non-painful living, en masse, and is therefore objectively evil. \n\nLike: \"shouldn't I be able to use money on myself?\" of course, in utilitarianism it's a spectrum. It may pay to have bins on that spectrum, just for mental model, where one bin of wealth contains enough self-serving wealth for comfortable living.

The larger problem is that much of the wealth held by the upper class comes from rentier capitalism rather than productive enterprise. The largest extraction of wealth from the working class occurs through the rental value of land and the unearned appreciation of assets. This system concentrates wealth among asset holders and blocks wealth building for the lower and middle classes. A shift toward commons-based policies like a Land Value Tax or a Digital Commons Tax would redirect these unearned gains back into public benefit, strengthening the economy for everyone and limiting private capture. This is one of the major flaws of shareholder capitalism, and why stakeholder-oriented economies, such as Germany‚Äôs, have produced stronger and more equitable outcomes."

Nice subtle gradient animation in the background.\n\n\\- The header logo can be clicked on within the main-page and I get a little nod and a wink, but visiting other pages like your About, Privacy, Terms does not show the animation and does provide a link back to the Main Page.\n\nSo you might add a \"Call to Action\" / 'Send a letter' button in a top corner of your header so visitors are always brought back to the main page.\n\n\\- Lastly, I think the navigation on the bottom of your site could be placed above your page header below your little hat icon. Either Darken the text so it has more contrast over the background or enlarge the font size a bit more. It's just a bit too difficult to see the navigation and you have to scroll down to see it when you first visit your domain.\n\n\\- EDIT: Ideas just keep popping up. I think people would get a kick out of the carbon footprint that is reduced by utilizing this service. If I sent a piece of mail from Boise, Idaho to London, England, I'd be contributing to a fair amount of pollution to get that piece from point A to point B. If I was to use your service, it would be cool to see how the letters carbon footprint has been reduced. What would be the GHG comparison between the two deliveries. ----- Could I pay more to expedite a delivery or add a dozen roses to it with a box of chocolates? \n\n  \nI love this service!"

(i'm personally not into sans serif or handwritten fonts and i don't think they fit your aesthetic but hey, if you want to include them that's also fine)\n\n\\- i wish there was an option to add more files or to resize the images, so that we can layout the letter to avoid wasting space and paper\n\nthat's all i have for now. will update this comment if i had other ideas!"

    "author": "supercubsam",
    "text": "Howdy!\n\nMy name is Sam and I'm a private pilot &amp; self taught iOS developer from the Seattle area. A couple years ago, I had an idea for an app similar to Strava, but for pilots - where instead of sharing screenshots of flight tracks, we can actually have interactive flight track based posts. Alas,¬†[Hangar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hangar-social-flight-tracker/id6468550769)¬†was born.\n\nWhen I first started building Hangar in Nov 2022, I was working full-time as a construction project engineer. Ten-hour days on the job site were immediately followed by late nights at my desk talking to ChatGPT and trying to figure out how to code. I didn‚Äôt know anything about building apps, but was pretty good with computers and considered myself a fast learner. At one point, I gave up and listed my Mac Mini on Facebook Marketplace for $150 less than I bought it for, but luckily it didn‚Äôt sell. Six months later in July 2023, I picked it up again and somehow had an app ready to launch by March 2024.  \n  \nThis TikTok encapsulates the journey really well: [Story of Hangar TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@flyhangarapp/photo/7444685008570305823)\n\nLiving off savings, I knew the first 6 - 12 months would hardly bring in any money since I was focused on attracting users and improving retention. In September of 2024 I started to monetize harder and focus on \"Pro\" features. Sep to Oct were pretty slow, but November saw a huge jump doing 7x what any of my previous months had done. This is my current spread of features, some being free and some pro:  \n\n\n* Flight Sharing (Strava like feature. Free. All the social features are free.)\n* Live GPS tracking, fully automated by iPhone location services. You can have loved ones sign up for 'non-pilot' accounts and get notified when &amp; where you takeoff/land. They can also see you on the map. This solves the pain point of pilots that are constantly in different tail numbers, but still want to keep their loved ones in the loop. (Pro)\n* Airport suggestions with things to do on/around them. (Free. In the flight feed.)\n* Leaderboards (Free)\n* Airport discovery map where you can filter by things to do, runway surfaces, usable (length) runway, &amp; more. (Pro)\n* Profiles: Airport map that keeps track of all the airports you have been to. (Pro) Stats, posts, user info (Free)\n\n  \nIt's been a major grind and definitely detrimental to my fitness/health during some periods lmao, but it's getting so close to paying the bills. If anybody knows any better ways to market this/has any ideas at all for me, please feel free to reach out! I will attach some photos below and you can find Hangar's website [here](https://www.flyhangar.com/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8b56b3pmhmbe1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf48e624d4a59aa286cae7dc70b01964f768b96e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bhtyezmwhmbe1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a133b1530b02326d06a616facba5e7471b1d1a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cetasxgnhmbe1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea497b08e0b1bf1cae4a6621624bdcb4cc944548\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chmtk84ohmbe1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecca325dca8735df7d3d05aded19ceb7ad9ebddc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8h2xnl7qhmbe1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c927f2931cfd8f54f0e40d8223924d0fae45f98d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqduhrqqhmbe1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e08409128fb3081ae582b84b4fca177788f2f598\n\n\n\n",

Fortune smiles upon you. :)\n\n&gt;If anybody knows any better ways to market this/has any ideas at all for me, please feel free to reach out!\n\nSince you said this, I have thoughts!!\n\n* I'm not a pilot, but is it possible to monetize using curated sponsorships ([Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) as the primary example that comes to mind) in addition to Pro accounts? I have to imagine your users have eyeballs that are valuable to reach.\n* If eyeballs are valuable and TikTok/social media is your #1 means of user acquisition, I think I'd spend time making **Hangar** your #1 means of user acquisition.\n   * Discounts (onramps to paid accounts) can be remarkably effective AND build your user base at the same time! *\"Invite 5 pilot friends, get X months of Pro for free\"*\n* Speaking of user acquisition, if you're wanting to grow the user base to pay the bills, consider your [TAM, SAM, and SOM](https://foundationinc.co/lab/tam-sam-som) and how you can expand your SOM:\n   * Target Addressable Market (TAM) - How many pilots are there in the world?\n   * Service Addressable Market (SAM) - How many of those pilots are accessible to me?\n   * Service Obtainable Market (SOM) - How many of THOSE pilots are accessible given competition (other apps) or operating constraints (iOS only)\n\nIf you can dial in your TAM, SAM, and SOM, you can set realistic user acquisition goals that move the needle.\n\nAnd remember, *\"Riches are in the niches!\"*\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: Added link to article about how to calculate TAM, SAM, SOM"

I went to the chicken coop, where our largest hen Penny had just laid a beautiful golden-brown egg. Penny had always been my favorite chicken, and she had quite the personality. Why, she once chased off a menacing fox from the coop! But that's a story for another time. I took the warm egg into the kitchen, where I would begin my very first cooking adventure, and carefully laid it upon the counter. Filled with the excitement, I ran to my mother, still in bed with a cool cloth upon her forehead, where I asked her how long to cook the egg.

Specially for pasting into task/todo list apps.   Currently it seems a user can only select one small chunk of the recipe at a time.\n3. Feature request: Optimize page for accessibility read back, maybe even add a read aloud button with text-to-speech tech hooked up.

    "title": "my app went viral last week - here's what happened",
    "author": "risquer",
    "text": "**TLDR: it ended up on national radio - stats at the bottom**\n\n# Monday:\n\nI posted the app on HackerNews at about 11AM, checked the website analytics before I went for lunch noticed maybe 6 people on the site - nothing huge. Went for lunch with my laptop screen still on the realtime analytics screen, I came back and saw 1500 people on the site. I couldn‚Äôt help but let out an audible ‚Äúwhat‚Äù. I checked the hackernews post and it was top of the site and the comment section was overwhelmingly positive. My fianc√©e then calls me to tell me that someone that she works with mentioned touch grass.\n\nThis freaked me out and it was hard to focus on anything in fact I even missed my train whilst standing on the platform. It was the first time this week that I legitimately could have gone bankrupt‚Ä¶\n\nNaively, I didn‚Äôt optimise my site so I was serving a 12MB video on every site load and this was eating away at my bandwidth limit from my hosting provider - I had to upgrade to mitigate and by that evening even though my bandwidth allocation was x10 what it was in the morning the site had chewed through 70% of the 1TB allocation with no signs of slowing down.\n\nObviously, the only solution was to optimise. First I compressed the video down to 3MB, but with the number of visitors heading to the site the bandwidth was still getting devoured. I looked into how to optimise further and I stumbled across CDNs - migrated the video hosting onto a service called¬†[bunny.net](http://bunny.net/). That was the biggest bandwidth cost taken care of.\n\nMeanwhile, I‚Äôm freaking out. At this point 8 different people had individually reached out to me via email, Instagram and Linkedin sending me their CVs, talking about funding, people working at large companies talking about opportunities. So, I reach out to Nolen (@[itseieio](https://x.com/itseieio)¬†on Twitter and Bluesky) for advice on how to deal with the overwhelm. He has had multiple websites go MEGA viral on Twitter, he‚Äôs the creator of [https://onemillioncheckboxes.com/](https://onemillioncheckboxes.com/) and he has dealt with this all before. He‚Äôs incredibly kind, offers very sage advice and is kind of responsible for what happens next.\n\nHis advice boiled down to:\n\n* get your costs under control - you won‚Äôt think about anything else until you do. you won‚Äôt even be able to sleep.\n* respond to people with something along the lines of ‚Äúhey, thanks so much for the interest! My app was way more popular than I expected - I'll definitely get back to you but it might take a sec‚Äù\n* take a step back and enjoy it! If you're getting a flood of emails it's because you made something that people like, and that's worth savouring :)\n* Finally, and possibly most importantly - ‚Äúmake a followup post on Twitter and Bluesky so that I can repost it‚Äù.\n\nI did exactly that that evening - I tweeted ‚Äúi built an app to stop me doomscrolling by touching grass‚Äù with a video demo.\n\nI went to bed unaware of the consequences of that Tweet.\n\n# Tuesday:\n\nI woke to a message from Nolen saying ‚Äúyour tweet is doing numbers‚Äù - I open Twitter and see something like 200k views with the number ticking up by tens of thousands every minute.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, to feel recognised at this scale for something I built didn‚Äôt feel real. The attention was actually very overwhelming. ‚ÄúBut this is all that you‚Äôve wanted‚Äù, I thought to myself why was I feeling so paralysed with overwhelm.\n\nI decided to reach out to my manager at work to let him know what‚Äôs going on and to see if he had any advice with the attention. To be fair he was great at 1) calming me down and 2) giving me actionable advice to get me out of the state of paralysis I was in.\n\nHe made me realise I had time to fix everything - the app was launching on March 14th so I could fight all the fires that were appearing. Essentially the message he was drilling into me was \"PLAN, PLAN EARLY, PLAN WITH OTHERS AND NOT IN ISOLATION (GET ADVICE)‚Äù. I‚Äôm feeling at lot more at ease about the launch now, as of writing.\n\nThe priority at this point was still to control costs. I migrated my site away from Netlify to Cloudflare Pages. The free version of Cloudflare Pages offers unlimited bandwidth so this was a no brainer. Another fire out.\n\nMeanwhile, the first media articles start to appear online. A couple of relatively niche outlets to begin with but then a journalist from FastCompany reaches out and requests an interview.\n\nI go to bed with my head spinning.\n\n# Wednesday:\n\nI wake up having slept a lot better know that I‚Äôm not going to go bankrupt from all the web traffic. I check Twitter to see my tweet begin to slow down, it ended on 1.2M views, mental. I thought I‚Äôd be in for a quieter second half of the week, which is when Dextero posted a tweet about touch grass. This tweet goes even more viral than my original one!\n\nStrangers are posting about the app, my cousin texts me out of the blue saying that his colleagues are talking about the app in the office. This is insane.\n\nIt‚Äôs a normal work day so I try to focus on my day job, it proves difficult but I don‚Äôt think you can blame me.\n\nI clock off work and turn my mind to the next pressing issue, if I release the app now Google Vision‚Äôs API costs will bankrupt me. I need to refactor this to run on device. Originally, when I wrote the app I was planning to use the same system to recognise grass on both platforms so a third party API made sense. However, given the popularity of the app I worked out that I basically could afford a month‚Äôs runway with that window closing rapidly as more and more people were predownloading it. There was no other way than to rewrite the image detection to run on device. TensorFlow was a thing that I heard about before so I immediately started researching that. Training my own models seemed like I would experience a huge drop off in the quality of the grass detection, there surely must be a better way. It hadn‚Äôt even occurred to me that Apple provide their own Vision framework which has labelling capabilities! They do and it works well! So I switched it out (keeping the original Google Vision processing behind a feature flag). I moved my threshold values and labels that I need to detect to remote config so I can tweak in production if needed. I apologise to Android for using Apple‚Äôs framework, I am thinking about how to approach this but that is a problem for future Rhys.\n\nI submit the new version to the App Store and this feels like a huge win, taking off a lot of pressure.\n\n# Thursday:\n\nAfter some back and forth with the App Store Connect reviewers the new version is approved and over night the first Youtube Shorts videos had started appearing!\n\nBen Esherick (600k subs) made a video talking about the app - I reach out to thank him and he responds in a very friendly way. I wonder to myself how much would this have cost to contact him first and ask him to make a video about it.\n\nAn Instagram post also goes viral in Indonesia, I always thought that this joke would do well in the English speaking world but it truly went worldwide.\n\nThe predownload numbers are strong now. My goal for launch was to have 1000 predownloads. We exceeded that number for two days in a row.\n\n# Friday:\n\nJust as I thought things couldn‚Äôt get any more crazy, a Youtuber with 6 million subs (John Casterline) makes a short about touch grass. The video racks up 4 million views. I am speechless at the reception, basically 99% positive comment about the idea. And yes, Canada, I know it snows in your country‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm working on it I promise.\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt the only mention of it on Youtube that day. A Youtuber that I‚Äôve been watching for the best part of a decade mentions it on his podcast. Linus Tech Tips. This is a woah moment for me.\n\n# Saturday:\n\nBecause of everything that happened on Friday, this day was the record pre download day. We‚Äôve far exceeded the 1000 goal I mentioned before now.\n\nI attempt to take a step back and just bask in what had already been a crazy week. I somewhat manage to do this and I‚Äôm feeling good. I think the app is ready and in a good place for launch.\n\nThere is a lot of people now waiting for the app which is of course scary but I think I‚Äôve done a good job, and yeah it‚Äôs initially for a laugh but I think it genuinely could change people‚Äôs habits.\n\n# Sunday:\n\nIt‚Äôs Sunday, surely a calmer day right?\n\nI decide to go to the gym with my fianc√©e in early afternoon. Out of no where a friend from primary school that I haven‚Äôt spoken to for the best part of ten years messages me saying that he‚Äôs just heard them talk about touch grass on HeartFM, a nation radio station in the UK. We find the nearest bench and begin frantically Googling trying to listen to a replay of Heart. Low and behold the DJ is chatting about touch grass and how she loves the idea. I never expected a stupid app that I make to be a talking point on national radio - even writing that down is ludicrous. What a way to finish the week.\n\nA mental week. The app went this viral without even being available for download yet, I‚Äôm still in shock as I write this. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre interested in how many predownloads all this attention brought, here‚Äôs a snapshot of the latest App Store Connect stats:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/81kaqxvpejme1.png?width=2800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=587249b963f2a6e5d297c96afe43d2e0b61d86c3\n\nI‚Äôm grateful for everyone who took the time to engage with my silly little app. I‚Äôm grateful for those who were ready to listen and advise at moments notice. I‚Äôm grateful for younger Rhys, who never stopped creating, no matter how hard things got simply because he loves it\n\nSee you March 14th.\n\n  \n",

Seeing the hype around your idea helps validate that there's a market for these types of apps.\n\nI'm launching in April, if you're curious, here's the lander:\nwww.unquestapp.com\n\nI love the simplicity of your lander. A video can explain so much without any words. I think I'll have to make a video as well.\n\nI'll follow you to see how the app progress goes. Perhaps we can keep in touch and share our learnings. :)\n\nCheers!"

I love having the camera off so I can stand up and walk around whale I talk, or look off into space - it really aids with concentration (while looking like it does the opposite). Hah, you could call it something like ‚ÄòMask On‚Äô I‚Äôd buy it - could also be great for nervous people in interviews, or those with visible tics."

I know people who have their day so booked up with \"mandatory\" meetings that they don't have time for their actual job during the week. Sometimes you really are expected to sit on an hour long meeting to speak for 30 seconds, or it will politically harm your project to not be in an otherwise unnecessary meeting. This isn't just an issue of employers doing this. Plenty of people try to justify their job by sucking their coworkers into these meetings.\n\nAdditionally, there's much simpler cosmetic applications. Some people have really expressive facial reactions and want to appear composed anyway. Even simpler is a scenario like my desk setup: I face a large external monitor but the webcam is built into the laptop off to the side. Even though I'm \"facing\" the other participants on my monitor, to them it appears I'm distracted and looking away at almost all times. \n\nThe absolute simplest application is someone who's looking down because they're referencing paper or writing notes. Or event that have issues with public speaking. \n\n\nTo paraphrase one of the worse/recenter X-men movies, if you're given a pen it doesn't mean you're gonna stab someone with it, even though you could. Pen's just a tool to use, not a guaranteed intention."

    "text": "Hi, I'm Laszlo, a full-stack developer from Hungary. In March 2022, inspired by Wordle's popularity, I created [Actorle.com](http://Actorle.com) \\- a game where players guess actors and movies. It took just three days to build, and I had no idea it would become anything more than a fun side project.\n\nThe start was rough. After posting on Reddit, the first comments were discouraging. One user said it was \"insanely hard to win,\" and another declared it \"literally unplayable\" because it didn't include John Hurt. I almost abandoned the game, but fate had other plans.\n\nA week later, traffic suddenly surged. An old-school British website called [b3ta.com](http://b3ta.com) had featured Actorle in their newsletter. From there, it spread through Twitter shares and even got featured on Mashable. The game went from 500 daily users to thousands, then tens of thousands.\n\nWith growing traffic, I explored monetization options. I started with a simple \"Buy Me a Coffee\" donation button, which surprisingly brought in about $1,000 in just three months. I also ventured into mobile app development, which was challenging but educational. However, the real breakthrough came when I partnered with an ad provider called Ezoic for the website.\n\nThe ad revenue soon matched my full-time salary. After careful consideration, I took a leap and quit my job to focus on this unexpected opportunity. To keep the income steady, I regularly update the game's database and occasionally add new features like dark mode and seasonal challenges. I also created spin-offs like [Actorle.tv](http://Actorle.tv) for TV buffs and [5doodles](https://metime.games/game/doodle/) for people who love doodling.\n\nTwo years later, Actorle still generates around $4,000 monthly, with minimal ongoing effort. This stability has allowed me to spend more time with my family and to explore other projects.\n\nThis journey taught me valuable lessons. It's worth giving your ideas a shot because you never know which one will succeed. Feedback matters more than numbers - hearing that my game brought people happiness is far more motivating than just seeing user statistics grow. Being open to different monetization strategies and focusing on creating value for users is crucial.\n\nWhile not every side project will lead to passive income, this experience showed me the potential of turning simple ideas into sustainable revenue streams. It's worth exploring your ideas - you never know where they might lead.\n\n  \nUPDATE: I recently launched a promising project that I hope will become my next success. It's called [https://whichcountrytomoveto.com/](https://whichcountrytomoveto.com/), and it started as a simple wizard to help users find their ideal relocation destination. Since then, I‚Äôve been working to expand it into a comprehensive resource for people considering relocation. It was even featured in Morning Brew, which brought a significant surge of users, and I‚Äôm now trying to build on that momentum. Check it out if you consider relocation.",

So, every time someone you referred makes a prediction or places a bet, you get a commission from the platform. It‚Äôs a great way to earn passively without actively playing the game yourself.\n\nIf you manage to get 100+ referrals, you can become a super affiliate and start earning 35% of the fees, which can really stack up over time. It‚Äôs especially useful if you already have a following on social media, a blog, or even within crypto communities. You could share your referral link, and the platform even pays out daily, so you‚Äôll see your earnings pretty quickly.\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre already in any crypto or passive income groups, this might be an easy way to rake in some extra cash without much effort."

The right tool for the right job. The operational cost is 4 digits per month (because i also have a staging pipeline which I use before release and also used for benchmarks under heavy loads to check for memory leaks or other issues) and it can scale easily as I also have the possibility to split the data processing pipeline into different independant groups (which is good for reliabiltiy too as one can go one down and not affect everyone).",

I'm used to thinking 1 website - 1 dashboard.\n- On \"Zero cost, zero stress\", Maybe stress is not the right word here, the copy on the side is great i.e. \"see if it's right for you!\".\n- How does realtime work from a site vistor perspective, are they sending heartbeats every few seconds while they are on the website?\n\nYou must have learned a lot building this.

The pricing is essentially based on page views (as the real cost of infrastructure is based on the number of requests to ingest). The number of dashboards and sites is secondary I would say. Every dashboard is fully customizable with widgets that you can add, resize, place where you want and remove. So that's why there is a limitation on the number of dashboards. For example in my own use case I'm using only one dashboard to monitor 50+ websites so it depends on how you want your data to be displayed. For example you can create another dashboard with limited number of data and share it to the public or a team.  \nAbout the real-time question, you're right, the visitors send pings at regular intervals and/or when an action is performed (like visiting another page). I've indeed learned a lot of things building this project :)"

It's not the end all be all obviously and I can sympathize with our community being bombarded with similar ideas/chatgpt wrappers but it's only because of the massive utility A.I is able to provide to both the engineering and product side. \n\n  \nIMO the real issue is that many of the side projects of recent seem to be converging on the same ideas because of the shrinking technical mote. The applications OP pointed out are the immediately obvious A.I use cases that are being saturated first (notetaking, transcription, trackers, etc ). Now that product engineering is a commodity(A.I tools, no code, outsourced app logic to LLMs), creativity and problem identification will be the new differentiators to success. The useful/valuable projects will float to the top as the generic ones sink. \n\nOverall it's a net positive, but I can understand the annoyance. It's the cost of finding this gold mine we call transformer architecture.

Notice I'm not talking about people that never coded or developers that use AI (I'm on this group), I'm talking about real idiots that are just gambling with software to make money, refusing (even joking) that developers are not needed anymore. The damange they are creating will be measured once this bubble explodes, but even if they get a \"profit\" service in the future, the mess that they created will require several engineers to address it.\n\nIs like the contractors industry in the 2000s: Everyone wanted cheap developres from India, Argentinra, etc... they could have entire teams paying the salary of a senior developer... their software got extremely hard to mantain, hard to scale. Basically most of these companies ended up hiring people on site again spending more money (even in some cases some projects were needed to be rewritten from scratch)  \nThe pattern is always the same:\n\n\\- Hey I made this because I had X problem (startup pitch approach)\n\n\\- Is a SaaS\n\n\\- Has a suscription model\n\n\\- Usually is a clone of a working product in the market\n\n  \nAt some point admins should start to put stricter rules on which sides should be added here, but for me any side that is already saying is \"vibe coded\", \"AI first\", \"any trend shit to prove they are just using AI to clone something\"  is already a nope."

        "text": "Hi there üòä It's been a while since I've given an update on my side project!\n\nFor a few years now, I've been building an alternative to Product Hunt, named Uneed. As you can imagine, it's not an easy market üòÖ.\n\nBut the site has grown little by little and has benefited from the recent Product Hunt drama, caused by indie hackers who were tired of not being featured.\n\nI'm still far from PH's numbers of course, but I've reached **$4K in revenue in the last 30 days**, which is an incredible step for me ü•≥!\n\n\n\nCurrently, the main differences between Uneed and Product Hunt are:\n\n- **Everyone is assured of being featured**. A limited number of products are launched daily, which means there's a queue. You're assigned a launch day (you can pay to change it), and that's it!\n\n- **I don't plan to raise funds and depend on investors**. Which means I won't need to transform the platform into a paradise for VC-backed startups üòÇ\n\n- **Votes are multiplied based on your activity**. The higher you climb on the leaderboard, the more valuable your votes become!\n\n\n\nMy next steps:\n\n- **Integrate analytics for creators**, to have the number of impressions and clicks of their tools on Uneed\n\n- **Make upvotes public**, with graphs accessible to all, and a public \"honesty\" score. If this score becomes poor and cheating seems obvious, the product will be taken offline.\n\n- **Emphasize community features**. I plan to move more towards something like Indie Hackers. I want everyone to be able to post news about their products!\n\n  \n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nDo you think the direction I'm taking is the right one?\n\nAnd finally, if you've already used Uneed, do you have any feedback to share with me üòä?\n\n\n\nThank you üëãüèª",

I recently launched a tool called ValidateSaaS that helps validate SaaS ideas. Seeing how you've made things super simple with a one-click approach highlights how important it is to reduce friction for users. Simplicity truly is key!\n\nIt's also interesting that Gemini suggested this idea to you. I've been using AI extensively in developing ValidateSaaS, and it's amazing how AI can spark such innovative concepts.\n\nBuilding something over a weekend and getting it out there quickly is so powerful. I try to do the same with my projects‚Äîrapid development and quick launches can make a difference.\n\nYour quick user growth is a great sign that you're onto something. If you're thinking about the next steps, consider how to keep those users engaged and consider monetization down the line.\n\nKeep up the fantastic work! It's always inspiring to see fellow entrepreneurs making strides with their ideas. If you're ever interested in chatting more about market analysis or anything, feel free to reach out or check out ValidateSaaS. I'd love to hear how things progress for you!",

    "title": "I made a lifting app that makes $3k MRR",
    "author": "astashov",
    "text": "**TLDR; I've made a weight lifting app, that currently makes ~$3K MRR. There're all the various marketing failures/successes I had - described what worked for me and what didn't, and overall experience of having a long-term side project.**\n\n# üèãÔ∏è How it started\n\nI started to lift weights 4 years ago.\n\nIt happened super randomly. I was reading Michael Snoyman's blog (he writes about Haskell programming language mostly), and there was a blogpost [\"Why I lift\"](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2017/06/why-i-lift/). I found it super inspiring. As a software engineer, he explained how he got into lifting weights, and how it improved his life. And he suggested starting with Stronglifts 5x5 program if you're a beginner.\n\nI got a gym membership, and started following Stronglifts 5x5 program. They have a nice app that handles progression for you, increases and decreases weights, it is very well structured and easy to follow.\n\nBut despite what Stronglifts author writes on his website, it's a beginner program. It's not a rule-them-all program. After doing it for like 6-9 months, you can't progress on it anymore, and need to switch to something else.  Most of my lifts got stuck on the same weight, and I lost motivation to go to a gym at all.\n\nI dug into Reddit communities like /r/fitness, /r/workout, etc. Apparently, there're other programs, that are good as a next step after Stronglifts, like 5/3/1 or GZCLP. I got used to having an app to track a progress after Stronglifts, so I wanted to find a similar app that would also automatically progresses me to higher weights and new personal records.\n\nI found an app for 5/3/1, and started to use it. It wasn't so smooth and nice as Stronglifts, and also I lost all my history after switching to a new app, and that was sad.\n\nIn about 4 months, I got bored with 5/3/1, and found a new hypertrophy program on Reddit, and wanted to try it - Lyle's Generic Bulking. But there was no app for it... So I, like a caveman, had to track the progress on a notepad.\n\n# ü¶ñ Liftosaur was born\n\nAbout the same time, Covid started to walk over the planet. We got locked into our homes, and I had more free time than I had before. For funsies, I started my own app for the Lyle's Generic Bulking program, and called it \"Liftosaur\". It quickly became a generic weightlifting app though where you can define any weightlifting program.\n\nI wanted to have an app, where you could build any possible weightlifting program. Define absolutely any possible logic for reps changes, weight changes, sets changes, etc, etc. The life-long app where it'd have you weightlifting progress over the years of different programs and exercises.\n\nSo, for Liftosaur I came up with a special scripting language \"Liftoscript\".  It's very simple, with Markdown/JavaScript-like syntax, where you only have if/else, variable assignments and a couple of unique types (like pounds or kilograms).\n\nUsing that language, you can define any logic for your weightlifting program, and then follow that program. You want reps increasing every time you successfully finish an exercise, growing e.g. from 6 to 8, and then resetting to 6, and simultaneously bumping the weight by 5lb? You can do that. You want having 5x8 sets, but if you fail, it switches to 7x6 sets, but if you succeed - switches to 5x8 back? You can do that. Almost everything is possible.\n\nAfter you've done with the program, tracking is super easy - you just go to the gym, and tap squares to log sets. And you'll have graphs, personal records, history of workouts, etc. \n\nFor a while it was just a pet project, but then I thought - it's actually a pretty featureful weightlifting app, probably one of the most powerful in its niche, so maybe I could get some money out of it?\n\nSo, I added subscription - monthly, yearly and lifetime, and made some features paid. Push notifications for the rest timer, graphs and plates calculator became paid features.\n\n# üöÄ Marketing\n\nNow, the main and probably the most interesting part - THE MARKETING!\n\nBuilding an app is simple. But spreading the word and marketing is hard. Most of my marketing efforts didn't really work. That doesn't mean those channels are bad, it's just I suck at them.\n\nSo this is the list of my failures:\n\n## Failures ##\n\nFirst, I posted on Product Hunt, got maybe 8 upvotes there. Posted in some communities on Reddit, got banned in some of them, but had rather warm welcome in smaller ones.\n\nTried to grow Twitter account, Instagram account - that didn't work, I never had any traction there. It's a lot of work - you need to post constantly, and I frankly didn't know what to post about. I hired a marketing agency, and they posted Tiktok videos almost every day for a month, but they rarely went over 1000 views.\n\nI tried to do affiliate program, but never got anybody interested in it. Tried to cold-DM a bunch of fitness influencers on Instagram (about a hundred), but didn't receive any response at all.\n\nTried to do \"creator marketing\", when you pay some big accounts to post a video about you.  The price range varies a lot there - from $100 to $1000, but ROI from that was horrible - I don't think I got any customers from those. Usually those promo videos don't have a good engagement and don't get many views, even if the influencer has tons of followers. Way more successful approach probably would be to come up with a strategy, and do a long term contract work with influencers - like post 30 videos over a month for $1000 or something like that - but one-off videos work really poorly.\n\nI tried to invest into SEO, but didn't have a lot of success. I created a page for every single exercise (about 300 pages total), and some free tools pages (e.g. 1RM calculators), but they all are mostly on like 50+ positions in Google SERP, so don't get much traffic.  It'd probably help a lot to get backlinks from other fitness-related sites, but I couldn't find a way to convince them to place links to Liftosaur on their sites.\n\nThere's one app (which is my main competitor) that particularly does marketing well - Boostcamp. They partnered with all the main fitness influencers, they somehow got the links from all the popular fitness tools, from various fitness magazines and blogs. They've been a huge inspiration to watch them growing, and I sometimes wonder how they were able to get all those partnerships! I wish I could be like them! :) But I probably need to find my own unique way to position Liftosaur.\n\nSo, to summarize - this is what failed for me:\n\n* Social Media\n* Creator Marketing\n* SEO\n* Affiliate program\n\nThere're some things that worked though. \n\n## Successes ##\n\nOne is tailoring app to specific Reddit communities. For example, there's a guy - Cody Lefever, who came up with a nice set of principles how to structure your workouts. He called them - GZCL. He also created a bunch of programs based on that principle. There's a whole community around that (r/gzcl).  I asked Cody if I could add his programs to my app, and he didn't mind. So, I implemented all of them, and posted about that in r/gzcl subreddit. That was quite successful, my app quickly started to get recommended within this subreddit pretty often.\n\nAlso, ads worked quite well. I tried Reddit Ads and Google Ads. Reddit Ads had low CTR, and generally users were not converting very well. I targeted audience by subreddit, trying various combinations, and generally had CTR ~0.3%, and low conversion rates of those who clicked.\n\nGoogle Ads on the other hand worked quite nice. But need to make sure you set up audience right. When I just started with Google Ads - I set up a campaign, and went to bed.  When I woke up in the morning, I saw HUGE increase in installs, and Cost Per Install was just a few cents. SUCCESS! (as I thought). But apparently it all was coming from India, and people were using the app, but not really paying. But it could be a nice way if you mostly care about installs / eyeballs, but not users spending (e.g. if you monetize via ads).\n\nAfter setting a filter on countries, and only targeting UK/Canada/US, I still got to ~0.85$ per install, which is pretty nice. So, as a next step I want to improve some visuals, and make the app onboarding easier, and then I could restart the campaign with bigger budget.\n\nAnd the main driver (maybe?) of growth was community building, which happened kinda semi-accidentally.  I created a subreddit and Discord, and put links to them inside the app and on the website.  People mostly were joining for support (like when things didn't work, or they wanted help with their programs), but some left to just hang out there, and now it's a pretty friendly community.  People share the Discord and subreddit around, and it's likely the main driver of growth right now.\n\nAgain, to summarize - this is what kinda worked:\n\n* Addressing needs of a particular subreddit\n* Google Ads\n* Community Building\n\n# üéß Support\n\nAs I mentioned above, for support I created a subreddit and a Discord channel, and also pointed to the email.  Support takes quite a lot of time, people are having questions/issues all the time. But this is also a great indicator of things that work well and not that well in the app, in UI and UX. All those questions, issues, suggestions really helped to shape the app into what it is right now, and I'm so THANKFUL to all the people who participated!\n\nAlso, now I can just throw an idea, or some design prototypes into Discord, and get feedback from real users - this is so cool!\n\nPeople are usually very thankful if you helped them, even if it is you who actually screwed up (like, you had a bug in the app). I had many cases when after I helped some person, they bought subscription or lifetime.\n\n# üìà Current Stats\n\nI currently have\n\n* ~2.5K montly users\n* ~2K weekly users\n* ~700 daily users\n* ~$3K revenue from subscriptions (that's after Google/Apple cut)\n\n# üèÅ Conclusion\n\nBecause (or despite) all my futile efforts, the app still somehow grew to ~2000 users who use it every week. I think that's mostly because of **consistency** - I enjoy growing my little app, so I don't mind spending every free second on it.\n\nIt's super inspiring to know that there's so many people open it every day and track their workouts through it. Some people really push the limits of the app - making super big and complex programs, using that built-in scripting language.\n\nOne cool thing that there's really no way to fail. I have a full-time job, which pays the bills, and I can experiment with marketing and the features, without being afraid to run out of money. Hosting costs very little, and as long as I keep investing time into it, it probably will continue to grow.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what should be the next steps regarding marketing though. Maybe I should double down on Google Ads? Try Meta ads? Let me know in comments what worked for you!\n",

The text editor I have in the app - CodeMirror - supports it too, so I get syntax highlight for free. Actual language evaluator is custom, written in TypeScript, as well as all the logic for deconstructing and then constructing back the program text based on the exercise logic.\n\nThat's like e.g. if an exercise has linear progression, and needs to bump the weight by 5lb, the app rewrites the program text from `Squat / 3x8 100lb` to `Squat / 3x8 105lb`"

TLDR; - I tried to adjust the monthly/yearly/lifetime prices based on the country GDP, and apply that across 170 countries in Apple/Google.

To answer that, I need to know average user value in $$$, and it's kinda hard to measure at this point. It feels like on average if I divide 2.5k MAU by $3k revenue (after store cut), that's like $1.2 per user monthly.\n\nI only target Android for now, UK/US/Canada, and got $0.85 per install. I target people with search keywords like \"gzcl, gzclp, 5/3/1\", etc - i.e. who's interested in particular programs I have built-in in the app.\n\nI also recently integrated with MMP (AppsFlyer), and now I can also track cost per signup, per active user (i.e. finished at least one workout) and per purchase.

Why?\n\nBy default it rounds by 2.5kg, so rounds 44kg -&gt; 45kg. You can change the default rounding if you tap the edit icon near exercise during workout. You can also specify the equipment there, and then it'll round to the plates you have available for your equipment (mostly useful for barbell/loaded dumbbell exercises).\n\n&gt; Also, I haven't figured out how to track RPE. I checked your docs, but it's not clear to me. Is it also possible to use progression with RPE, like when I hit RPE 6 I want to add weight?\n\nYes, but for that you'd need to write a custom progress function, or use a built-in `lp()` progression - i.e. linear progression. The exercise line would look something like this:\n\n```\nSeated Row / 3x8 45kg @6+ / progress: lp(2.5kg)\n```\n\nThat would mean that if for **each** set the completed reps were 8 or higher, **and** the RPE for each set was equal or lower than the required RPE (6) -&gt; then next session increase weight by 2.5kg."

You push your offer in front of them on IG, they convert to become new clients, and that manual work you spoke of earlier? Out the door.

I thought I'd have more control over the language, it'd be less dangerous. People can share programs via links, and if somebody imports a link, that can execute arbitrary JS code - that may lead to security problems. So, I'd need to ensure I have strong sandbox, which could be tricky.\n\nAlso, Liftoscript has some custom types, like pounds or kilograms, and math internally will convert them.

That makes sense, although IMHO it's still nice to have an intermediate language with more concise syntax, so you can quickly adjust your program when necessary.\n\nWeightlifting programs are not set in stone, you constantly tweak them. Change weight, add reps, etc. All the Liftoscript logic in progress/update blocks also will change the program text after finishing the workout. Like if you had \\`Squat / 3x8\\` in the program, and you finished all the sets, and you had logic to increase reps if all sets are completed - Liftoscript interpreter will rewrite the program so it'd be \\`Squat / 3x8\\` now.\n\nThe idea of having LLM that would convert plain english into Liftoscript is really powerful though. I think many users already do that in ad-hoc way - feeding Liftoscript docs into Claude or ChatGPT, and asking it to build a program in it.",

I got high on the 50% MoM growth and thought I can monetize my users whenever I want and the party will keep going.\n\nWell, I got a little bit ahead of myself like a dummy. I quit my job 4 months ago and started tightening my freemium option and asking users to pay. Queue my weekly active users dropping from 70K to literally like 9K and only \\~400 paying users at $4/month. I had to keep dropping prices to get any kind of decent conversions. My growth is less than 1/10 of what it used to be now that I started charging and tightening my freemium even more just absolutely kills my leads.\n\nI guess I'm trying to figure out what to do next. kinda feels like I jumped the gun quitting my job, with a mortgage nonetheless, but here we are. Anyone else been through this? any tips for getting back on track? Ideas to jump start growth again?",

I‚Äôd set a target for the point at which I could comfortably pay myself while sustaining the business without any stress.\n\nNext, I‚Äôd go back to the users who are currently paying or have paid before. Reach out to them for reviews and feedback‚Äîthis is invaluable for product improvement and gives you some real testimonials to use in marketing. Then, put effort into a mix of organic and paid marketing. Social media, SEO, and a bit of PPC for Google Ads and Facebook Ads can all go a long way if managed right. Upwork has plenty of great freelancers who could help with specific areas of your marketing, allowing you to oversee things and ensure the brand voice aligns with your vision.\n\nUse the customer stories and feedback as social proof on your platforms‚Äîthink social posts, blog content, and testimonials on your website. Over time, this should help increase traffic and, ideally, conversions. Once you find that rhythm and see consistent growth in your paying customer base, then consider scaling it up further and setting a decent wage for yourself.\n\nAnd if that means getting a side job temporarily to keep things afloat, that‚Äôs totally fine too. This approach will give you the flexibility to reinvest in growth without the stress of immediately needing a salary from it. Just my two cents!",

So, is the core service that is offered by your app's features the real reason for people to use your app? If they use your app only to get chatgpt for free, are there any new apps that are offering chatgpt's access better than you ? Did you address the right audience, I mean the one that is likely to pay for an app not the one that is looking only for free options ? Is your paid upgrade worth the value compared to the free version ? \n\nAsk yourself the right questions, conduct some investigation by trying to ask some users about the choice they made to stay on your app or to leave it ? Relocate the user in the center of your reflection, study market changes and you'll uncover the real reason for this drop. Investigate !",

It's always better to have one user paying $1K/mo than 1K free users. I'm a big fan of Rob Walling, and he always advises avoiding freemium unless you've received a big investment and have some virality built in.\n\nThat said, you've got thousands of users who are interested in your product, that's a great opportunity to learn more about them. Talk to them. Like, literally ask them to have a Zoom call with you (offer a free month or a $20 voucher in return). Ask them what made them use your product, what they were trying to achieve, how much they use it, why they wouldn't pay, and what you should add to make them pay. Be aware that they will lie. Saying \"I would pay if your product could XxX\" makes them feel good but doesn't oblige them to pay so always follow with \"so, if I add this by tomorrow, may I send you an invoice?\"\n\nThese 35K users are probably many different kinds of people, and there's a chance that there exists a niche that would pay for your product. Your goal is to figure this out. By talking to people, you'll find the main benefit of your product (or something that would pay for)., then you'll be able to build your landing page based on that and set up ads targeted to your niche.\n\nTrying to get more users by lowering prices is a dead end. 99% of your users won't pay even if you price it at 1 cent. It's just the \"everything should be free\" mentality of the consumer market, even stronger in certain redacted large countries. You should improve your product to make people want to pay for it instead. How to improve it? See above.\n\nAlternatively, you can treat it as a lesson, sell it or shut it down, and start the next thing by talking to people and finding what they will pay for."

You could be pricing out your users, even at $4 a month. \n\nIn Cuba, for example, the average monthly salary is 30 to 40 USD. $4 a month represents 10% of the average monthly income for a Cuban. Would *you* pay 10% of your monthly income to use your iMessage application? I would guess probably not.\n\nYou might consider changing the pricing structure to better accommodate people who are limited in budget. A lot of cell phone plans have a limited number of texts that can be sent and received, and while in the US we are pretty much all on unlimited texting, cheaper options prevail in countries with a lower cost of living. What if you had a per-message cost that came down if they joined a subscription plan? Or sold packages of credits to use up, instead of unlimited access? Have you done the math on what you spend per credit and what you could afford to charge while still making a profit?\n\nPirateSoftware is a game developer who decided to lower the price of his product in Brazil, specifically because they had already built Brazilian Portuguese into the game and they knew the sticker price was too much. Brazilian users now represent 25% of purchases of their game.\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/44Do5x5abRY",

Your customer base are people who are savvy enough to understand personal assistant and automation. It is very likely they are also OpenAI subscribers. When it was free folks used it. But when you start charging the first thought is I‚Äôm already paying to something that has this ability. Why should I spend more for something that‚Äôs a wrapper around it.

Given a latency below 500ms you don't even need to show a spinner or skeleton content which would produce an ugly flash.\n\nAlso, if you think \"elegance\" and \"making the app look more alive\" are more important than not wasting the users' time, you really need to inform yourself better.\n\nThis is what the Nielsen Group has to say about this:\n\n&gt;  A snappy user experience beats a glamorous one, for the simple reason that people engage more with a site when they can move freely and focus on the content instead of on their endless wait.\n\nhttps://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-response-times/\n\nIn case you don't know, the Nielsen Group has been one of the most important UX authorities in the business, for decades.",

    "title": "I've made over $1.2 million from my iOS app side projects, ask me anything!",
    "author": "stuart_k_hall",
    "text": "I've shared more details [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/building-mobile-apps-as-side-projects/). But thought it might be interesting to some people here as well, so I've reposted in part below.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions, I'll try and answer them all if I can.\n\n--\n\n  \nI‚Äôve long been a big believer in side projects both back when I was an employee through to now as a [founder](https://appbot.co). They can be a lot of fun ‚Äî you can learn a lot to help you in your day job and maybe even make a bit of money on the side.\n\n  \nI‚Äôve managed to get millions of downloads and over a million USD of revenue from my side projects.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fu4dqnwjy1ad1.jpg?width=1999&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=391f5d06674ee978dabb45b8dd1edf573393af47\n\n# Why start a side project?\n\nThere‚Äôs so many reasons why you might want to start a side project, including:\n\n* You want to try out a new technology¬†\n* There‚Äôs an idea you just can‚Äôt let go of\n* You want to make a bit of money on the side\n* You want to broaden your skill set (for example you‚Äôre a designer who wants to learn to code or vice versa)\n* The list goes on\n\nI have two mobile apps I maintain to this day and they were born for very different reasons.\n\n[7 Minute Workout](https://7minuteworkoutapp.com/)¬†was born because I wanted to run an experiment. Could I build an app, iterate, and build a story around it? It ended up getting millions of downloads, got acquired, given back to me and generated¬†[some content](https://stories.appbot.co/how-i-got-2-3m-app-downloads-without-spending-a-cent-on-marketing-f4823b6bc779)¬†that was read by hundreds of thousands of people and helped propel Appbot in the early days.\n\nI created¬†[WordBoard](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordboard-phrase-keyboard/id960167417)¬†to scratch an itch. Apple had just announced custom keyboards for iOS and I was frustrated that I couldn‚Äôt easily re-use phrases and text. WordBoard has been a long slow burn, but has actually ended up being more successful than 7 Minute Workout. More on that later.\n\n# Why a mobile app?\n\nOpting for a mobile app as a side project offers a compelling blend of accessibility to tools and education, opportunity and maintainability. Nearly everyone owns a smartphone today, making mobile apps incredibly relevant to a wide audience. This universality means whatever you create, be it a game, a tool, or something totally from left field, it has the potential to resonate with a wide audience.¬†\n\nDistribution is taken care of for you by the app stores and they can also potentially do a lot of your marketing. The built in payment tools and workflows simplify the maintenance greatly, we will dig into this in more detail later.\n\nThe one big thing I love about mobile apps is that, if you choose the right idea, you might not even need a server. It can be completely self contained. No downtime, no servers to maintain, no fixes in the middle of the night!\n\nThus, mobile apps make a great choice for side projects.\n\n# Choosing the right project\n\nThere‚Äôs a few criteria I like to check off for a side project:\n\n1. Is this something I‚Äôm actually interested enough in to keep at it for years?\n2. Is anyone else likely to want this app?\n3. Can I make version 1 in a reasonable time frame?\n4. Can it exist for months on end without any intervention from me?\n5. Is there a popular trend or technology to leverage at launch?\n\nAs I mentioned above, the 7 Minute Workout app was built as an experiment, but the idea still needed to be chosen. At the time the 7 Minute Workout was buzzing around the New York Times and Hacker News. I was actively doing the workout every day and wanted a simple timer and instructions rather than following some pictures. It was something I could build quickly and easily.\n\nWordBoard jumped on a new technology from Apple, third party keyboards. New iOS versions and new technology can be a great way to try and get featured on the App Store. Turns out I didn‚Äôt get featured at all, and the launch was slow, but WordBoard has grown over time with a loyal user base. I also had a bit of time off to kill and decided to spend a couple of weeks getting the app out of the door.¬†\n\nOften the best ideas are the most obvious ones. The ones that just keep whirling around in your head that you can‚Äôt forget about.¬†\n\n# Give it time\n\nSuccess can take time and iterations. One of the advantages of a side project is there is less pressure to make it fly on a time frame (without it having to support you financially) compared to a startup or day job.¬†\n\n# Ask away\n\nGot any questions? Fire away.",

Can it exist for months on end without any intervention from me?\n5. Is there a popular trend or technology to leverage at launch?\n\nAs I mentioned above, the 7 Minute Workout app was built as an experiment, but the idea still needed to be chosen. At the time the 7 Minute Workout was buzzing around the New York Times and Hacker News. I was actively doing the workout every day and wanted a simple timer and instructions rather than following some pictures. It was something I could build quickly and easily.\n\nWordBoard jumped on a new technology from Apple, third party keyboards. New iOS versions and new technology can be a great way to try and get featured on the App Store. Turns out I didn‚Äôt get featured at all, and the launch was slow, but WordBoard has grown over time with a loyal user base. I also had a bit of time off to kill and decided to spend a couple of weeks getting the app out of the door.¬†\n\nOften the best ideas are the most obvious ones.

Or my only option is to get a list (from a corpus) an use it as a source?\n\nPS: I know that I can use the url to go directly to the result page, but that would  mean using my own list of words as a query; exactly what I'm trying to avoid (because I want to make sure that I get ALL the possible the results, thats the reason why). - An maybe because that would mean probably thousands of 404's, not good :)\n\n  \nThanks for taking the time to read my question ;) \n\nWe Developers are among the most generous people out there regarding the free sharing of knowledge and you are just another true example of it (judging by your kind answers).

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd approach it:\n\n1. **Start with a known set of words.** Take a handful of initial words you‚Äôre sure are in the dictionary and scrape their pages.\n2. **Follow related words.** Each result page lists related or other words (though not as normal links). By examining how these words are fetched (e.g., they are linking via AJAX calls), you can uncover new words to scrape. *I have listed the endpoint it is using below.*\n3. **Automate the discovery process.** By substituting the parameters (like word and ID) in your requests, you can keep discovering more words.\n4. **Keep track of what you‚Äôve scraped.** Maintain a log or database of words you‚Äôve already processed, so you don‚Äôt end up scraping the same ones multiple times.\n\nOver time, this ‚Äúcrawling‚Äù approach will likely let you discover and scrape the entire dictionary. For instance, check out how the endpoint behaves at:  \n[https://dle.rae.es/?e=1&amp;id=KE1iGlD&amp;w=beautiful](https://dle.rae.es/?e=1&amp;id=KE1iGlD&amp;w=beautiful)\n\nDoes that make sense?",

There's not much you can do about that. It's just the nature of the beast. This will eventually drive the price to zero as each app lowers the price little by little. There are already tons of other cocktail apps (that likely aren't as feature rich), so the space is just going to get more crowded.\n\nIf you want to keep the momentum going for now, you need to put everything you've made so far into marketing on other platforms. You may also want to think about localization at some point, but that's a big expense so may not be worth it.\n\nReally though, marketing will make or break it. With the holiday season coming up, you can do lots of interesting campaigns around holiday cocktails, etc.\n\nYou should also mentally put a price tag on it to sell. It's unreasonable to expect any app like this to be consistently profitable for years, so you should just decide what price point you're comfortable with so you can get out while the getting's good.\n\nGood luck and well done!"

That‚Äôs not what this project is about. I am working on moderation features like rate limiting, filters, opt-in visibility, and community-driven tools. I just didn‚Äôt go into detail in the video because it felt too much for a short preview.\n\nAlso, a lot of what you described: spam, hate speech, illegal content. They're risks for any platform without safeguards. Facebook or Reddit would be the same without the systems they‚Äôve built to manage those issues. So I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to treat this as a problem unique to my idea or to assume I‚Äôm ignoring it. That said, I do agree that something like this, without any moderation, this extension could make it easier for problems to show up. It removes a few steps for bad people. On an unmoderated Reddit, for example, they‚Äôd still have to link their post to a site. With this extension, it might be easier to drop harmful content right where people are. \n\nThat said, I genuinely appreciate you mentioning these concerns. I didn't even think of some of these issues you brought up. And I‚Äôm grateful for that. It gives me more to think about and plan for.\n\nThis is r/sideproject. I‚Äôm not trying to build the next Facebook. Like everyone here, I‚Äôd love for my project to succeed, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs still a side project. You can critique it, but I don‚Äôt think it makes sense to treat it as if it's already a massive platform with millions of users.\n\nAnd honestly, that‚Äôs probably on me. The way I made the video may have given off the wrong impression. I just wanted to share the idea and see what people thought. I didn‚Äôt expect to cover every moderation detail in a short clip."

You're an edge case and you can expect to get taken down.

What about getting labeled for making snuff, gore, other non nudes. Or lewds with untenable topics like children. Or for use in defamation. Apple and Android will have to make decisions about this.

So I thought it might be a good idea to make a system so people can enjoy this AI from their phones. But as a solo dev, it's not easy. This whole year, the only time I don't work on this is when I'm sleeping.\n\nIf you have an idea, just start sharing that idea to people. If they are interested and keep asking you about that, start making a design and prototype. You have several options, you can hire contractors or even a freelance dev to do the development from scratch to deployment to app stores."

Maybe there is a way you can monetize things without driving users away? I definitely think this could succeed, whether you decide to use it for other people to make adult art or porn or not. I do think that one of the major selling points is that it could create realistic AI porn, as a lot of the other free things out there will not do that, and even the ones that will do that  do not do a great job. (Yes I have tried other AI porn apps lol and they are horrible).\n\nAnother thing is that as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I have to say your app does an incredibly realistic representation whereas other apps will not, NSFW sexual in nature or romantic SFW. \n\nWell done. I could also see this being incredibly useful for people that want to do things like create greeting cards, or personalized messages, or stories. Sort of like the AI version of JibJab. If you're able to add some kind of preset video, that could also be a thing.\n\nI would say if you add more features, maybe make a contribution or donation part of the app where if people donate they get added features. That could increase interest while also keeping things low cost for those that cannot donate.\n\nThanks for sharing and for allowing healthy adult content to be createdüôÇ. We need more people with open minds like you. \n\nAnd yes, I think it could turn into an adult content generator, but it could also be used for entirely PG related purposes.

Making flash cards, illustration books, pics for blog articles, youtube cover, or whatever you want really.\n\nFor two different apps... I think it would be hard to maintain both. I probably just keep it this way. I don't want to make a dedicated porn app, but I hate censorship too. So the app is an image generation tool. What people make with it, is their own choice and responsibility.\n\nPreset video won't be possible but in the future, I may be able to let users to upload and generate videos when I have access to more computing power.\n\nI'm very glad that you like it.

    "author": "ChewyLuck",
    "text": "Hey r/sideproject!\n\nAfter too many group dinners and trips derailed by clunky expense apps, I built **YAAT** (\"Yet Another Accounting Tool\") to focus on the simple act of *helping people get paid back*.\n\nDoes the world need another one of these tools? Maybe not. But nothing I tried felt intuitive, focused on the use cases I cared about, or priced fairly. So, like any person with more ideas than spare time, I built my own.\n\nYAAT isn‚Äôt a budgeting app. It doesn‚Äôt care about your income or spending categories. It just helps you track shared expenses and settle up ‚Äî cleanly and quickly. My goal is to make this *the easiest way* to manage group travel expenses.\n\n**What makes YAAT different:**\n\n* **Super focused** on two core use cases:\n   * **Dinners out** ‚Üí scan the bill, split by item, request via Venmo\n   * **Group trips** ‚Üí keep a running tab between friends and settle up at the end\n* **No downloads, no logins** ‚Äì works instantly in your browser\n* **Scan receipts** for itemized splits\n* **Clean, fast UX** that stays out of your way\n* **Settlement mode** for longer trips that temporarily locks expenses while everyone pays up\n\nI‚Äôve been building this over the last few months and testing it with my friends on real trips, dinners, ski weekends, etc, and iterating with their feedback. There's more to do but I think it's about ready to share with more people!\n\n**A few learnings from this project:**\n\n* **Cursor** 3xed my dev speed but also got tough to manage once the codebase got big. I've mitigated the frustrating loops by having it continuously update READMEs with reports on what it's tried before and what the \"correct\" pattern.\n* **Nothing beats real-world testing.** I think everyone on this subreddit knows this already but there's no replacement for real user feedback. Major bugfixes (e.g. around multi-currency settling) and key features (like settlement mode) came directly from watching friends use it.\n* **OCR is getting better fast**, but preprocessing helps: asking users to crop, then sharpening and filtering the image improved scan accuracy a lot. GPT-4.1 also felt like a meaningful leap on receipt parsing.\n\n**Try it free right now:** [getyaat.com/scan](https://getyaat.com/scan)\n\n**What‚Äôs next?** I‚Äôm looking for **beta testers** ([sign up here](https://getyaat.com/beta)) to try this out on real trips and tell me more about what‚Äôs broken, what‚Äôs working, and what‚Äôs missing. The site is in English only for now, but for my international friends you can track in one currency and settle in another (e.g. add expenses in USD, settle in EUR).\n\nYAAT is totally free for the time being. I‚Äôll eventually charge to unlock advanced group features (one-time per group, no subscriptions) but don't have specific plans around that yet. For now, I‚Äôd just love  feedback.",

This will be a one-time fee that can be split across all group members, so for example if it costs $10 and it's a 10 person group, it'll be like each person owes $1 :)\n\nFunctionality wise I think YAAT already matches 90% of what Splitwise does, although it is purposely optimized for group travel.

I looked over the landing page and this looks like a really solid, well-constructed app. I can see you've thought through a more structured use case with categories and more persistent groups, which makes a lot of sense for certain kinds of travelers. \n\nA couple thoughts:\n\n* I get the tradeoff between accounts vs no accounts. It‚Äôs definitely a philosophical split; YAAT prioritizes zero-friction almost to the extreme, which comes with its set of problems. That said, I don‚Äôt totally agree that letting people pick their items later *requires* accounts. YAAT actually supports that flow too: anyone with a group link can manage the assignment of items at any time, during or after expense creation, and without needing to sign in. Just a different take on trust + simplicity.\n* On pricing: 5 AI scans/month feels a bit tight, especially for larger groups on a week-long trip. In general I think \"per-user\" vs \"per-group\" is a strong architectural distinction where IMO per-group is more intuitive (unless you clearly expect one person to be the \"group expense manager\"). I'd consider increasing this cap to encourage growth, especially earlier on.\n* I was curious about this line: *\"Create a vacation group and invite all travelers (they don't even need the app to participate)\".* How exactly does that work in practice, given the account requirement you mentioned?\n\nAlso, would love to hear how you‚Äôve been reaching users so far (via advertising, or word of mouth?). And what kind of demographics are you seeing adopting the app?  \n  \nEither way, cool to see more folks working on this problem too, definitely beats the status quo. Good luck with it!"

Would be great if there was some sort of integration, and within the app I could check off which credit card purchases to add to the trip (and how it's split).\nTap credit card, push notification comes in, I add it to trip.  \n\nNot sure how (or even if) this would work.

My core principles rn are keeping it **private, zero-login, and \"just works\"** so no sensitive data sharing or account linking is required.\n\nLonger term, I could imagine supporting something like this *if* there‚Äôs strong demand and a clear way to do it without compromising my philosophy (and would probably be something I'd monetize). But I can tell you I wouldn't be prioritizing this anytime soon.\n\nIn the meantime, a good workaround is to **scan your receipts right after paying**, so you don‚Äôt lose track of what was ordered or who had what.

I've been looking for something like this for a while, but I like your interface / experience the best so far. \n\nThis works great for splitting restaurant bills, but for grocery bills it falls a little short. \n\nI'll use Costco as an example, as it's a common store. Costco taxes some items and some it doesn't, so the split totals are wrong. Also the scan does not incorporate sales, so for every item that had a sale (when the receipt shows the original price then the sale below) the scanner just takes the original price. \n\nFor the tax it may be just as simple as adding a checkbox for each item to mark as taxes / not taxed. For the sale idk what the right solution is, but it is pretty inconvenient to go in and edit the price for each item.\n\nOtherwise great app and I'm looking forward to see where it goes."

    "author": "Ordinary-Narwhal-777",
    "text": "I wanted to share my journey building [JuicySearch](https://juicysearch.com), an OnlyFans search engine that's taken off much faster than I expected.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nOnlyFans is huge - $7.9B revenue in 2024 with 5M+ creators and 400M users. But there's a major issue: OnlyFans has no native search functionality. Users can only find creators through direct links from social media or other channels, making discovery incredibly difficult.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nAfter studying all the existing OnlyFans search engines and reading countless Reddit threads about what users actually wanted, I spent 5 months building JuicySearch with these features, and I think I got the best product available right now:\n\n* **Natural language search** \\- Type anything and get relevant OnlyFans creators\n* **500K+ indexed creators** in our database (classified with local uncensored LLMs)\n* **Location search** \\- Find creators near you (city/state level for US, country level globally)\n* **Advanced filters &amp; sorting** \\- Narrow down creators by numerous attributes, and sort by many options (age, gender, fetishes, body preferences, content type etc.)\n* **TikTok-style browsing** \\- Switch between grid view to TikTok style browsing with even more details about creators\n* **Image search** \\- Upload a photo to find that creator or similar OnlyFans creators using face match\n* **Wishlists** \\- Save creators you're interested in\n* **Browser extension** \\- Find similar creators while browsing OnlyFans available on [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/juicysearch-find-similar/kfciakcobdnemeaidkmobaolicalfakp?authuser=0&amp;hl=en) and Firefox\n\n**First Month Results**\n\nAfter 30 days of promotion, I've done some paid ads, but also organic promo, getting 50% of traffic directly with:\n\n* 50K users\n* $2K+ in revenue (CPA, CPL, CPC)\n* 6+ minutes average time on site\n* 20% returning users daily\n\nThe key difference between JuicySearch and competitors is relevance. Other OnlyFans search engines prioritize paid placements over relevant results. I only show sponsored creators when they actually match what people are searching for. But also I have much better filtering and sorting options, wishlists, TikTok browsing style, and image search no one else offers.\n\n**What's Next**\n\nI'm working on enhancing location search globally, improving the matching algorithms, and also will work on search suggestions but need more data for this. Each day I'm thinking about new features that I can add.\n\nThe main work will still be doing promotion. SEO is the primary focus but I don't want to push it unnaturally. I'm sure I have the best OnlyFans search engine, so SEO will come naturally over time.\n\nWhat do you think? If you want to check it out and give feedback, I'd appreciate it!\n\n",

In fact after takeover, a percentage of the company is fired, some engineers are retained while the buying company starts a migration project, and after a year or two the product is quietely is killed. I've experienced this a few times myself. The founders are retained in a Vice President type capacity, but they are sunsetted after 1-3 years and are only there for morale.

Another reason is that I have a goal of winning a Webby for best personal website, so I have a desire to keep at it until I get close to that. As to what it is good for, it can do a lot, but I wouldn't recommend it to people most of the time to do anything. It's mostly just a POC right now and I could see other people putting their use cases in it, but I don't feel passionate yet about any specific use of it, beyond my personal website."

    "text": "Most landing pages look nice but do not get people to sign up or buy.  \nHere is a simple and clear layout that helps convert visitors into users:\n\n# 1. Start strong with your heading\n\n* Write a clear headline that tells what your app does and why it matters\n* Add buttons like ‚ÄúDownload App‚Äù or ‚ÄúStart Free Trial‚Äù at the top\n* Show a phone mockup or video demo so users know what to expect right away\n\n# 2. Build trust right away\n\n* Add logos of your clients or companies that use your app\n* Show download numbers, awards, or press mentions if you have any\n\n# 3. Show your best features\n\n* Pick your top 2 or 3 features and explain them in a simple way\n* Add screenshots or visuals that match each feature\n* Focus on what makes your app better than others\n\n# 4. Explain why people should choose your app\n\n* Use short titles and a few lines to tell users how you are different\n* Mention speed, price, design, support, or any key advantage\n\n# 5. Add real reviews\n\n* Show what your users say about your app\n* Keep it short and add the person‚Äôs name and photo if possible\n* This builds trust and makes your app feel more real\n\n# 6. Answer common questions\n\n* Include a few FAQs to remove doubts\n* Focus on things people usually ask before signing up Like: Is it free to start? How long does setup take?\n\n# 7. End with a strong CTA\n\n* Repeat the offer and the download or signup buttons\n* Add another image if possible to keep things visual and easy to follow\n\nThis layout gives people all the right info step by step.  \nIt helps build trust and makes it easier for visitors to say yes.\n\n  \nPS : I used this design for my [SaaS](https://superwrapper.in/) and got 2000+ users\n\nIf your current landing page is not working well, try switching to this layout and test again.",

About 4 years ago, I wrote an article about Stripe radar rules, so I thought I would include some more context about how radar works and how it could be utilized preemptively to mitigate this type of situation from arising.\n\nA few rules that every merchant using radar should have in place, especially for a SaaS:\n\n1) Starting out are our 3D Secure rules all merchants should have:  \nRequest 3D Secure if :card\\_country: != :ip\\_country:\n\nThis ensures that the IP of the purchaser matches that of the country of origin for the card.\n\n2) You could push all abnormal risk levels into 3D Secure with:  \nRequest 3D Secure if :risk\\_level: != 'normal'\n\nThis rule forces Stripe Radar to force purchases that have elevated fraud risk factors through 3D secure  \n  \n3) You should also have four important block rules:  \n Block if CVC verification fails\n\nThis checks that the CVC/CVV matches the physical card\n\nBlock if ZIP code verification fails\n\nEnsures that you need a match on the postal code associated with the billing address of the card\n\nBlock if :is\\_disposable\\_email: and :is\\_anonymous\\_ip:\n\nThis rule uses Stripe‚Äôs internal list of disposable email providers and then checks to see if the IP address attempting to make a purchase is using a known list of Tor networks or proxies to mask their actual IP address from the payment gateway.\n\nBlock if :card\\_country: != :ip\\_country:\n\nThis rule blocks any transaction where the issuing bank‚Äôs country does not match the country of the customer‚Äôs IP address. We tested for this in the Request 3D Secure and then approved all valid 3D Secure authentications in the Allow ruleset. Here we are now, blocking all orders that didn‚Äôt pass the 3D secure validation.\n\n  \nIf you're interested, you can see a further explanation of the rules outlined at: [https://www.ecommercegorilla.com/preventing-credit-card-fraud-with-stripe-radar/](https://www.ecommercegorilla.com/preventing-credit-card-fraud-with-stripe-radar/)\n\nAlso, Stripe has the following article on rules generation: [https://stripe.com/guides/radar-rules-101](https://stripe.com/guides/radar-rules-101)"

I just poured a ton of time and energy into it over the past year, and started sharing it a little once it reached the point where it delivered on the initial vision of what I wanted it to be and to feel like. For pricing, I surveyed other planning tools out there and also chatted with some early adopters."

Totally understand that people might want to model differently in other cases though; so this is an area I'd like to add more flexibility to."

When I signed up it included a free trial, which is awesome, but will there be a way for me to enter the promo code you shared before I'm charged for the year?\n2. Will you be adding an option for inherited IRAs? (Or do they exist and I just haven't seen them yet?) I'm wondering if since the rules are so convoluted and specific that it might not be worth coding, but if that's the case it would be cool to be able to add it along with the RMD plan manually. \n\nThanks!",

Does it need semantic HTML to understand the site better?\n\nI'm not judging one way or another - it's just that in order for me to get over the hump and tell my client to use it, I would want to know what's required of me as the dev.  Because I could code something like this for my clients too, but I would prefer to just convince them to pay your fee, as long as I know what I'm getting into.  \n\nIt seems like your website is aimed at selling business owners, but I would bet 50% of your target \"user\" here might be a developer on the other end, so you could give a more technical pitch.\n\nYou got a perfect URL / name btw, good luck :)"
